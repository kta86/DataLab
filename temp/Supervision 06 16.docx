Supervision 16 June 2022 Last Meeting: 31/5/22 MIMIC III vs IV – some errors to do with ICU stays in hospital not linked to general hospital stays, timings (2001-12 vs 2008-19) etc. As 3 is most used in literature it is better to use it first and then use 4 later on (e.g. to test on a different data set). Taking advantage of RL over pure regression – what are the benefits? How do others use it? What makes it a better choice for industry and for the public and outline that in the RD5 Also for RD5 – what analysis should be done? I.E. Residual Analysis uses mean squared and only considers positive cases Week’s work: STEM kids class on RL – think it went well on the whole Read “Health Record Prediction” paper - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00513-5 . Like the way that they’ve outlined the steps needed and how it was implemented, however, it is a supervised learning method not reinforcement learning. But the idea of sequential risk prediction is interesting, particularly against current practices which may lead to “alert fatigue” with high false-positive rates Mimic-Sepsis code – uses sepsis 3 guidelines to determine sepsis (line 250 sepsis cohort.py) https://litfl.com/sepsis-definitions-and-diagnosis/ Looked into SOFA scores etc – found a python library that can compute a SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score - https://github.com/shimst3r/sofascore but also found out that different countries have different standards for sepsis, e.g. Australia typically use APACHE (Acute Physiology, Age and Chronic Health Evaluation (I-IV)) https://litfl.com/apache-versus-sofa-scoring-systems/ with SOFA better for predicting individual outcome and treatment response but APACHE used across patient populations – just another issue with sepsis management Managed to utilise CUDA on my laptop so I can take advantage of the GPU  Objectives for next week: Begin writing of RD5 – outline, plan and key areas of consideration/papers to include Read the paper Shufan put on Teams https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0213-5?sf200531662=1#data-availability
